A brutally honest, AI-powered salary estimator that analyzes your GitHub profile to tell you what you're actually worth in the Indian tech market.

## What is this?

Drop your GitHub profile link, select your experience and role, and get a realistic CTC estimate based on your actual work - not just your years of experience.

## How it works

The AI examines your GitHub profile and:

- Filters out tutorial repos, forks, and learning projects
- Analyzes your real, original work
- Checks repository quality, stars, and community engagement
- Evaluates technical depth and consistency
- Provides brutally honest feedback with no sugarcoating

## What you get

- Realistic salary estimate for the Indian market
- Specific feedback on your strengths and weaknesses

## Why it's different

Most salary calculators just ask for years of experience and give you a generic range. This actually looks at your code, filters out the noise, and tells you the truth about your market value.

No login required. No BS. Just honest estimates.
